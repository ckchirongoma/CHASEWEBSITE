Chase Continental Website Implementation Specification

**Cloudflare & Local Files Update (2024-07-07):**
- The site will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages, which supports Next.js and static assets.
- All assets (images, videos, client logos, prototype screenshots, etc.) will be stored in the project folder (e.g., /public/assets/ or /public/prototypes/).
- All content (prototypes, clients, blog posts, etc.) will be managed as local JSON/Markdown files within the repo, not in Airtable or any external CMS.
- All references to Airtable or external CMS are deprecated and replaced with local file-based solutions.
- Data fetching in the app will use local files (JSON/Markdown) and static imports, not API calls to Airtable.
